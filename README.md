# moa-classification-with-model-blending

This repo would contain a cleaner version of the solution to the kaggle [MoA prediction challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/) built by me and [mainakdeb](https://github.com/Mainakdeb). It's not complete yet, but there's lots of interesting stuff in there already. 

Will add documentation and explanations after the competition ends.
